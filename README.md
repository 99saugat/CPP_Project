# CPP_Project

***This program prints the truth table of a given expression.***

The truth table program was written by Saugat Baral(076BEL041), the graphics designing using Qt was done by Puskar Neupane, the K-map maker was written by Sangam Rana Magar and K-map grouping was achieved by Rabin Chaudhary of the group PRSS for object oriented programming project.

To run the program, download all the files, build and run main.cpp. For graphics, Qt software needs to be used.
